## Description

Nudibranch is a showcase of responsive web design layouts and elements using themes based on nudibranch colors and appearances. These layouts and elements are demonstrated on single scrolling pages found at /slugs/{species}. Since nudibranchs are not so well-known, especially by their names, the homepage features a gallery of images used for reference in creating the themes. Some themes have variants as the colors of a species varies.
